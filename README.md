# MTG-Discord-Bot

The MTG-Discord-Bot Utilizes Scryfall's api along with the Discord bot API in order to create a bot which is able to preform basic search functions either by name or by name and set. Fuzzy searching is also implemented and names for both the card names and set names so naming not need to be exact. Improvements to the design are expected as I have a couple of planned items that I wish to add to further flesh out the bot. Below are examples of how the bot works with the current commands that are possible within the system.

# Adding the bot
If you wish to add the bot to your own server there are two options you can take.

1. If you wish to host the bot youself you are welcome to download the source code using https://discord.com/developers/applications in order to create your own bot application and filling in your token to host it on your own PC or on a server. From here you can either download the code directly as a Zip, or download the launcher I have created using pyinstall to run the program. Be sure to have your bot's token key handy as the program will ask for it upon first launching it.

Libaries used:
Discordpy,
Requests,
theFuzz


2. By clicking the link below you can add the bot to your own server whom which I am hosting on my own PC currently. I look to expand and host the bot on a server for better uptime and reliability.
